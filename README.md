# Homelab 
These repositories leverage GitLab CI/CD to automate the deployment of applications and projects within my homelab environment. Each project is structured with the following components:
- GitLab pipeline for continuous integration and deployments
- Renovate bot configuration for automated dependency updates
- docker-compose.yaml for container orchestration
- Comprehensive README<br>
⚠️ Note: All deployment domains referenced are private and not publicly accessible. 
Repositories are mirrored from my Gitlab self-hosted instance.
